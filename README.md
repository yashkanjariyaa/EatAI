## Environment Configuration

### Client `.env` File

Create a `.env` file inside the `client` directory with the following:

```env
VITE_SERVER_BASE_URL=SERVER_URL
```

This variable points to the backend server API, enabling the frontend to communicate with the server or you can use this deployed URL - https://eatai.onrender.com

### Server `.env` File

Create a `.env` file inside the `server` directory with:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

This API key is necessary for integrating Google services within the server application.
